Explanation of handling multiple clients:  multiple games are handled simultaneously using a 
thread per game model inside of the serve_game() function. When two clients connect, 
they are paired and then given to the handle_game() function, which is run within a new background 
thread using threading.Thread. This allows each game to be run independently and concurrently, 
without blocking the server from accepting new clients. We continuously loop and spawn a 
new thread for each game, thus the server can support many simultaneous matches.
